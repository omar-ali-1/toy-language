# Toy Language in Python

This project contains code for a simple language interpreter, which takes a toy language input string, parses it, and evaluates and prints the result.

There are only two dependencies for this project to be run successfully (Python and the Python library rply), so please follow these steps:

1. Install Python 3.xx or higher.
2. Download this repository. 
3. Create a virtual environment in the folder where main.py is located using `python3 -m venv venv` in the command line on Mac.
4. Activate the venv using `source venv/bin/activat` in the command line on Mac. 
5. Run `pip install rply` in the command line on Mac.
6. Edit the input string in main.py, and then run `python3 main.py`, and the result value should be printed in the shell.
